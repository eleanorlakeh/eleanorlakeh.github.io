			    		</p>I am passionate about promoting equity in computer science. To learn about the topic, I highly recommend Jane Margolis' <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/stuck-shallow-end">Stuck In The Shallow End</a> and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/unlocking-clubhouse">Unlocking The Clubhouse</a>.</p>
			    		</p>Here's how I'm trying to help:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>
						  	<span>I worked with <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~vbarr/">Dr. Valerie Barr</a>, Mount Holyoke's computer science chair, on a research project that recalculated gender proportions in college computing education. You can read the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3239261">here</a>.</span>
						  </li>
						  <li>
						  	<span>I mentor introductory computer science students through Mount Holyoke's <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mtholyoke.edu/mage/">MaGE program</a>. I've also worked as a teaching assistant in three intro courses.</span>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<span>I believe an important way to equalize undergrad CS is providing opportunities to learn high-level skills. I volunteered to design and teach department-wide workshops on debugging and problem solving. I also co-created a coding interview prep workshop and ran a semester-long interview study group.</span>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<span>In my sophomore year, I was the chair of Mount Holyoke's annual <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mhcgitconference/">Girls in Technology conference</a>. GIT is an annual one-day event for local high schoolers to learn about coding and entrepreneurship.</span>
						  </li>
						  <li>
							<span>In junior year, I led a team of non-coders at <a href="http://sisterhacks.co/">Sister Hacks</a>, a hackathon for the Seven Sisters colleges. We <a href="https://eleanorlakeh.github.io/SisterHacks/">built a website</a> to teach coding by explaining concepts at various levels of abstraction. We won, which was fun!</span>
