			    	<p>I am a software engineer on the consumer safety team at Reddit. I studied computer science and sociology at <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/"> Mount Holyoke College</a>.</p>
					<p>In college, I interned at Reddit and Google; before my first semester, I worked full-time for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. (Doing full-stack engineering, backend engineering, and digital content writing, respectively.) My favorite parts of college were writing a senior thesis on parent involvement in selective high schools of choice, guiding an <a href="https://lilcs.github.io/">introductory web development class</a>, and generally thinking a lot about <a href="cs-ed.html">equity in CS education</a>. For more, see my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
					<p>I'm also passionate about dogs, iced coffee, and boy bands. I am the proud parent of a stinky beagle named Francis, who is named after Mount Holyoke alum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Perkins">Frances Perkins</a>.</p>
